# popit
This game is nothing more than a sketch than I imagined based on physical bubble fidget toys while trying the kotlin language.<br>
PopIt is a simple anti-stress game with wonderful Lofi beats in the background while you generate sequences of bubbles where you earns points by clicking on them, when you're ready and want more action you have the possibility to compete with other users online due to the existence of a score board.
